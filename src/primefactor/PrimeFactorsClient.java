/**
 * PrimeFactorsClient class for PrimeFactorsServer.
 * <p>
 * Your PrimeFactorsClient class should take in Program arguments space-delimited
 * indicating which PrimeFactorsServers it will connect to.
 * ex. args of "localhost:4444 localhost:4445 localhost:4446"
 * will connect the primefactor to PrimeFactorsServers running on
 * localhost:4444, localhost:4445, localhost:4446
 * <p>
 * Your primefactor should take user input from standard input.  The appropriate input
 * that can be processed is a number.  If your input is not of the correct format,
 * you should ignore it and continue to the next one.
 * <p>
 * Your primefactor should distribute to each server the appropriate range of values
 * to look for prime primefactor through.
